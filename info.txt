# Project Setup

1. The main script `main.py` is located in the `Peak Islands` folder.
2. All images are located in the `pictures/` folder.
3. Ensure that the file structure is preserved, with the `pictures/` folder beside the `Peak Islands` folder.
4. If necessary, adjust the paths to images in the code (e.g., for custom directories or when deploying the game).
5. The font used throughout the game is `Pixellettersfull-BnJ5`, which is also included in the project files.
